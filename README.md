# BookFinder
I undertook this project with the intention of mastering Combine and concurrency. Through building this application, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of how to integrate asynchronous operations and utilize Combine's powerful features. By implementing features like searching for books and fetching data from an external API, I strived to apply these concepts in a practical context. This project served as a valuable learning experience, allowing me to explore and experiment with SwiftUI's reactive programming paradigm and asynchronous data handling. Overall, it provided an opportunity to enhance my skills in modern iOS development, specifically in handling asynchronous tasks and data flow management using Combine.



This code is a SwiftUI application that allows users to search for books using the Open Library API and display the results in a list. Let's break down the code into its components:

In summary, this SwiftUI application allows users to search for books, fetches the book data from the Open Library API, and asynchronously downloads and displays the book cover images along with the book details in a list view.
